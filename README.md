Erlang-C PHP Class is a class that can be used to calculcate the required number of call center employees based on the inbound call/chat/ticket metrics. 

For example, you can find:

* The number of techs needed to answer XX% of calls within XX seconds
* The probability that there will be a delay based on the number of agents you have.
* The service level based on the number of agents you have.
* The average wait time based on the number of agents you have.


I spent quite some time looking for such a PHP class, and it appears nobody wants to share them, so I decided to share one that I found in Java format and edited to make it work on PHP. We must give credit where credit is due, so Here is a link to the original Java Class:
